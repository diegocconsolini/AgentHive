```

### Agent Orchestration
```javascript
// The platform automatically routes to appropriate agents:

"Review this React component for security issues"
// → Routes to: security-auditor + frontend-developer

"Optimize database performance for user queries" 
// → Routes to: database-optimizer + performance-engineer

"Debug production API timeout issues"
// → Routes to: incident-responder → devops-troubleshooter → network-engineer
```
