# SSP Realistic Failure Detection - Next Development Phase

## COMPLETED âœ…
- Database migration for failure tracking columns
- Realistic failure detection logic in SSPService.js
- Frontend interface updates for failure data
- Basic system testing with timeout detection

## CURRENT ISSUE ðŸš¨
The failure detection system is working (timeouts are detected), but failures aren't being recorded in the database properly. The migration may need to run on existing database or there may be issues with the column creation.

## NEXT ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. **Database Migration Verification** (20 minutes)
- Check if migration columns were actually added to procedure_executions table
- Verify database schema with SQLite inspection
- Force migration to run if columns are missing
- Test with direct database queries

### 2. **Backend Analytics Updates** (25 minutes)
- Update SSP analytics query in `getAgentSSPAnalytics()` to include new columns
- Add calculation for avg quality, success scores, failure reasons
- Return realistic success rates based on new failure data
- Test analytics endpoints with new data

### 3. **Frontend Failure Display** (15 minutes)
- Update SSP analytics components to show failure reasons
- Display quality scores alongside success rates
- Add failure breakdown charts/metrics
- Show realistic vs perfect success indicators

### 4. **Full System Integration Test** (10 minutes)
- Execute several agent calls to generate new data
- Verify failures are recorded with proper reasons
- Check that analytics show realistic success rates (not 100%)
- Confirm frontend displays failure information

## FILES TO WORK ON
1. `packages/system-api/src/services/SSPService.js` - Analytics query updates
2. `packages/system-api/src/storage/database/SQLiteStorage.js` - Migration verification
3. `packages/web/src/components/analytics/ssp/SSPAnalytics.tsx` - Failure display
4. Database inspection and testing

## QUICK WINS
- Force run the migration by deleting/recreating database
- Add console logging to see if failures are being recorded
- Update analytics to use new columns for realistic success rates

## GOAL
Complete the realistic failure system so SSP shows production-realistic success rates instead of 100% perfect scores.
