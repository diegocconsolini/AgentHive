# Project Brief

## Project Identity
**Name**: AgentHive - The Hive Mind for AI Agents
**Tagline**: "The orchestration platform for AI agents"
**Repository**: https://github.com/diegocconsolini/AgentHive.git

## What It Does
AgentHive orchestrates 88+ specialized AI agents to provide expert-level assistance across multiple domains. Instead of using generic AI tools, users get routed to the perfect specialist agent for their specific task, with persistent memory and context across sessions.

## Why It Exists

### Problems Solved
1. **Tool Sprawl**: Eliminates need to switch between different AI tools
2. **Context Loss**: Maintains conversation history across sessions
3. **Generic Responses**: Provides specialized expertise instead of one-size-fits-all
4. **No Memory**: Persistent context eliminates repetitive instructions

### Market Gap
The current AI landscape has generic tools (ChatGPT, Claude) and specialized narrow tools, but no comprehensive orchestration platform that intelligently routes to domain experts while maintaining context.

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope
- 88+ specialized AI agents across development, security, DevOps, business domains
- Intelligent agent routing and selection
- Web dashboard and CLI interfaces
- User management and authentication
- Context persistence and memory systems
- Performance analytics and monitoring
- Enterprise features (RBAC, audit logs)

### Out of Scope (Initially)
- Custom agent development by users
- Real-time collaboration features
- Mobile applications
- Third-party marketplace for agents

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Developer Productivity**: Reduce context switching and improve code quality
2. **Enterprise Adoption**: Provide scalable AI agent deployment for teams
3. **Market Leadership**: Establish as the premier AI agent orchestration platform

### Success Criteria
- **10,000+ registered users** by end of Phase 2
- **90% agent routing accuracy** for specialized tasks
- **50% reduction** in developer context switching time
- **Enterprise pilot programs** with Fortune 500 companies

## Key Stakeholders

### Internal Team
- **Product Owner**: Diego Consolini (author)
- **Development Team**: Current solo development, scaling planned
- **Target Users**: Developers, DevOps teams, enterprise organizations

### External Dependencies
- **AI Providers**: Claude (Anthropic), GPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google)
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud providers for deployment and scaling
- **Community**: Open-source contributors and early adopters

## Current Status
**Phase**: Transitioning from Phase 1 (Foundation) to Phase 2 (Intelligence)
**Completion**: Foundation complete, AI integration in progress
**Next Milestone**: Real AI model integration with intelligent routing

## Strategic Priorities

### Short-term (3 months)
1. Complete AI model integrations (Claude, GPT, Gemini)
2. Implement intelligent agent routing algorithms
3. Deploy context persistence system
4. Launch beta testing program

### Medium-term (6 months)
1. Multi-agent workflow orchestration
2. Performance analytics dashboard
3. Enterprise authentication and RBAC
4. External integrations (Slack, GitHub)

### Long-term (12 months)
1. Advanced workflow automation
2. Custom agent development platform
3. Enterprise marketplace launch
4. International expansion
