## Product Vision
**"The Kubernetes for AI agents"** - AgentHive is a comprehensive orchestration platform that manages, routes, and coordinates specialized AI agents for maximum productivity.

## Target Users

### Primary Personas

**Developer Teams**
- Need specialized AI assistance for different technical domains
- Want persistent context and memory across coding sessions
- Require integration with existing development workflows
- Value expert-level responses over generic AI interactions

**Enterprise Organizations**
- Need scalable AI agent deployment across teams
- Require role-based access control and audit capabilities
- Want analytics and cost tracking for AI usage
- Need integration with existing enterprise tools (Slack, GitHub)

**Individual Power Users**
- Switch between multiple AI tools for different tasks
- Lose context when moving between different AI interfaces
- Want specialized expertise instead of general-purpose responses
- Need command-line and web interface flexibility

## Core Functionality
