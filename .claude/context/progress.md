# Project Progress

## Current Status

### Branch Information
- **Current Branch**: `master`
- **Repository**: https://github.com/diegocconsolini/AgentHive.git
- **Status**: 75 commits ahead of origin/master
- **Working Tree**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)

### Recent Work
Based on continuation files and git history:
- Admin panel enhancements (2025-08-31)
- Flexible AI provider system integration (2025-08-31)
- Production-ready transformation completed (2025-08-30)
- Complete SDK documentation system (2025-08-30)
- Ollama integration phase 1 completed (2025-08-29)

### Current Phase
**Phase 2: Intelligence** - The project is transitioning from foundation (Phase 1) to implementing real AI model integration and intelligent routing capabilities.

## Immediate Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Push outstanding commits** - 75 commits are ahead of origin/master
2. **AI model integration** - Implement Claude, GPT, and Gemini integrations
3. **Intelligent agent routing** - Build the core routing logic
4. **Context persistence** - Implement memory system across sessions

### Development Tasks
1. Complete AI provider abstraction layer
2. Implement agent selection algorithms
3. Build context management system
4. Add performance monitoring capabilities

## Outstanding Work

### Phase 2 Objectives (In Progress)
- [ ] Real AI model integration (Claude, GPT, Gemini)
- [ ] Intelligent agent selection and routing
- [ ] Context persistence across sessions
- [ ] Performance monitoring and analytics

### Technical Debt
- 75 unpushed commits need to be synced with remote
- Need to verify all services are properly integrated
- Documentation updates required for recent changes
