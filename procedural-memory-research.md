## LLM Knowledge & Analysis: Advanced Memory Optimization

### Memory Hierarchy Principles from Cognitive Science
Based on extensive knowledge of human memory systems and AI architectures:

#### Dual-Process Memory Architecture
- **System 1 (Fast)**: Immediate pattern matching from cached procedures
- **System 2 (Deliberative)**: Complex reasoning when procedures fail
- **Memory Consolidation**: Convert successful System 2 reasoning into System 1 procedures
- **Interference Management**: Prevent new memories from corrupting established patterns

#### Memory Encoding Strategies
- **Chunking**: Group related actions into higher-level procedures (e.g., "authenticate_user" vs individual API calls)
- **Hierarchical Encoding**: Multi-level abstractions from atomic actions to complex workflows
- **Contextual Binding**: Associate procedures with environmental triggers and success conditions
- **Error-Correcting Codes**: Store multiple variations of procedures for robustness

### Advanced Implementation Strategies

#### Memory Retrieval Optimization
- **Semantic Similarity**: Use embedding vectors for procedure matching, not just keyword search
- **Temporal Locality**: Recently successful procedures get higher retrieval priority
- **Success Weighting**: Weight retrieval by historical success rate and recency
- **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Match current environment state to procedure prerequisites

#### Memory Update Mechanisms
- **Incremental Learning**: Update procedure success rates using running averages
- **Catastrophic Forgetting Prevention**: Maintain core procedures while learning new variations
- **Memory Replay**: Periodically rehearse important procedures to prevent degradation
- **Conflict Resolution**: When procedures contradict, use ensemble voting or A/B testing

#### Cross-Agent Memory Sharing
- **Federated Learning**: Aggregate successful procedures across agents without centralizing raw data
- **Procedure Versioning**: Track evolution of shared procedures with semantic versioning
- **Specialization Clustering**: Group agents by domain expertise for targeted procedure sharing
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfer complex procedures from expert agents to lightweight models

    this.temporalCache = new LRUCache(1000); // Recent successful procedures
  }
  
  // Multi-modal retrieval: semantic + temporal + success-weighted
  async retrieveProcedures(context, limit = 5) {
    const semantic = await this.contextIndex.search(context, limit * 2);
    const temporal = this.temporalCache.getRelevant(context);
    const successful = this.executionGraph.getHighestWeighted(context);
    
    return this.mergeAndRank([semantic, temporal, successful], limit);
  }
}
```
